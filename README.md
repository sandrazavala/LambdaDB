# LambdaDB
This repo includes my past work/projects in the UC Berkeley Introduction to Database Systems Fall 2021 class. COMPSCI W186 incorporated object-oriented programming in the 6 projects we worked on throughout the semester. We worked with languages such as SQL, Java, and MongoDB. Our projects were primarily based on storing, querying, updating, and managing large databases.
